I really love you kids..
please leave Liam Druhan to his own devices. If I am to Reposess my life from the Shady fucks that have Quested it for the last 20 Years,
I'm going to have to Kill the 3 Basterds That put my in this Situation - And that is the three gang-stalkers that done it to me..
* THe Three Asssholes are * 
1- Liam Sean Druhan (My Vampire Brother)
2- Perry Oppenheimer (Percy Wednesday)
3- Thomas Luke Papitheohari (The guy who Took My Leg)

Please dont do what anyone tells you to do - I would never control You, 
And if anyone ever does, Its because They never received an education from JellyBaby Primary.
we all know well - that Authority is absolute Abomination. Its the first Class we learn..
