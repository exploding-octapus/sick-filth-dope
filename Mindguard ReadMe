# Mindguard Hardware Safety & Emissions Lab

Purpose
- Educational toolkit for measuring, documenting, and mitigating unintended electromagnetic emissions from PCBs and consumer devices.
- Focus on transparency, reproducibility, and ethical practice.
- Not intended for any form of human-targeted remote stimulation, mind control, or covert behaviour modification.

Core principles
- Consent and accountability: all experiments must have informed consent and institutional approval where human subjects or sensitive environments are involved.
- Local, benign measurement: all instrumentation collects hardware telemetry only; no attempts to modulate people or transmit signals to influence behaviour.
- Open methods: publish measurements, mitigation techniques, and code so results are auditable and reproducible.

Contents
- /docs — lab checklist, measurement guides, safety notes
- /hardening — practical hardening checklist and layout guidance
- /tools — benign instrumentation scripts and examples (local logging only)
- /ethics.md — contributor ethics policy and required sign-off

Quick start
1. Read `docs/LAB_CHECKLIST.md` and `ethics.md`.
2. Assemble a basic emissions kit (spectrum analyzer or SDR, passive probes, near-field probe if available).
3. Run `tools/rf_survey.py` with local scope to gather hardware-only telemetry.
4. Publish anonymized, reproducible reports for peer review.

License and contribution
- Prefer a permissive license with an ethics addendum (e.g., MIT + ethics clause).
- All contributors must sign the Ethics Contributor Agreement before merging.
